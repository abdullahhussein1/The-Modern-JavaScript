--Without "use strict", everything still works, but some features behave in the old-fashioned, “compatible” way. We’d generally prefer the modern behavior.

--[confirm,prompt,alert] are modals, they pause the code execution and prevent the visitor from interacting with the page until they answer.

--Nullish coalescing operator:
The ?? operator provides a way to choose a defined value from a list of variables. The result of a ?? b is a unless it’s null/undefined, then b.

--Values null and undefined are special: they equal == each other and don’t equal anything else.

--Greater/less comparisons compare strings character-by-character, other types are converted to a number.

--The “switch” construct can replace multiple if checks. It uses === (strict equality) for comparisons.

--function Parameters can have default values: function sum(a = 1, b = 2) {...}.

//variable = box of data
let messege; //declaring a variable named messege to store data inside of it;
messege = "Assalamu Alaik brother ^-^"; //storing a string "Assa.." in a variable named messege(initializing)
console.log(messege); //shows the variable content;

// --------------------------------------
let a, b, c, d; //we can declare multiple variables together (not recommended)
//the recommended way is to declare them seperately
//a bit longer but easier to read ^-^

//In Sha Allah we will learn the difference between let and var in future chapters;
// -----------------CONST---------------------
const myBirthDate = "8/3/2001"; //we used const instead of let because we have an unchangable value

//capital-named constants are only used as aliases for “hard-coded” values.
const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";
/* 
Benefits:
1-COLOR_ORANGE is much easier to remember than "#FF7F00".
2-It is much easier to mistype "#FF7F00" than COLOR_ORANGE.
3-When reading the code, COLOR_ORANGE is much more meaningful than #FF7F00.

// ---------VARIABLE NAMING----------
/* 
There are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:
1-The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
2-The first character must not be a digit. 
*/
//variables must uniquely named
//variable names are CASE SENSITIVE
